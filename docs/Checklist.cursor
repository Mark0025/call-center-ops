### MVP Plan

#### Backend (Next.js API Routes)

1. **Set Up Next.js Project**
   - Initialize a Next.js 14.2 project with TypeScript.
   - Set up the project structure as outlined in Project-structure.md.

2. **Create Prisma Schema**
   - Define Prisma schema for the necessary data models:
     - User
     - Call
     - Agent
     - KPI

3. **Implement API Routes**
   - Create API routes for handling CRUD operations:
     - `/api/users`
     - `/api/calls`
     - `/api/agents`
     - `/api/kpis`
     - `/api/twilio`

4. **Implement Services**
   - Create service functions for business logic:
     - UserService
     - CallService
     - AgentService
     - KPIService
     - TwilioService

5. **CSV Processing**
   - Implement CSV processing using Pandas (via python-shell).
   - Integrate CSV processing with the API routes to upload and clean data.

6. **Twilio Integration**
   - Set up Twilio for making and receiving calls.
   - Implement functions to handle call statuses and responses.

7. **AI Voice Agent**
   - Set up Twilio for making and receiving calls.
   - Implement script management and editing features.
   - Develop AI models for natural language understanding.
   - Integrate with CRM systems for data synchronization.
   - Create reporting and analytics dashboards.

8. **Endato API Integration**
   - Implement phone number validation using Endato API.

9. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement Clerk Authentication.
   - Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles.

#### Frontend (Next.js App Router)

1. **Create Pages**
   - Dashboard
   - Login/Register (using Clerk)
   - Call Management
   - Agent Management
   - KPI Dashboard
   - CSV Upload

2. **Implement Components**
   - Create reusable components using NextUI:
     - AgentForm
     - Dashboard
     - Header
     - Layout
     - UploadCSV

3. **Integrate API**
   - Connect frontend with backend API routes.
   - Implement data fetching and state management (consider using SWR or React Query).

4. **Styling**
   - Apply consistent styling using NextUI components and custom CSS.

5. **Script Editor**
   - Implement a script editor with variable support for conversation scripts.

#### Database

1. **Set Up MongoDB**
   - Configure MongoDB connection.
   - Use Prisma as the ORM for database operations.

#### Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write unit tests for API routes and services.
   - Write unit tests for frontend components.

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints.

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Set up end-to-end tests for critical user flows using Cypress or Playwright.

#### Documentation

1. **API Documentation**
   - Document all API endpoints in `docs/API.md`.
   - Provide examples of requests and responses.

2. **Setup Instructions**
   - Write setup and installation instructions in `docs/SETUP.md`.
   - Include environment setup and running the project.

3. **Contributing Guidelines**
   - Provide guidelines for contributing to the project in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
