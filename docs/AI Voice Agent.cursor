### Detailed Plan for Building a Robust AI Voice Agent

#### Step 1: Clarify Goals and Requirements

1. **AI Voice Agent**: Create an AI Voice Agent that can handle calls, interact with customers, and perform tasks based on predefined scripts and business logic.
2. **Quality and Performance**: Use the best and fastest AI models available, prioritizing quality while being cost-effective.
3. **Business Logic**: Implement specific business logic for handling calls, including statuses like Verified, Wrong Number, No Answer, Voicemail, Dead, DNC, and No Status.
4. **Call Attempts**: Track call attempts and update statuses accordingly.
5. **Agent Performance**: Measure and improve performance using KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
6. **Data Handling**: Process and handle data from CSV files, including contact information and call details.
7. **Integration**: Integrate with Twilio for making and receiving calls, and with backend services for data storage and retrieval.

#### Step 2: Define the Data Model in the Backend

1. **Agent Model**: Define the schema for agents, including fields for name, email, phone number, status, call attempts, and KPIs.
2. **Call Model**: Define the schema for calls, including fields for contact name, phone number, status, attempt number, agent ID, and timestamp.
3. **KPI Model**: Define the schema for KPIs, including fields for agent ID, call ID, status, attempt number, and duration.

#### Step 3: Update the Agent Service

1. **Create Agent**: Implement the logic to create a new agent.
2. **Get Agents**: Implement the logic to retrieve all agents.
3. **Update Agent**: Implement the logic to update an agent's information.
4. **Delete Agent**: Implement the logic to delete an agent.

#### Step 4: Update the Call Service

1. **Create Call**: Implement the logic to create a new call.
2. **Get Calls**: Implement the logic to retrieve all calls.
3. **Update Call Status**: Implement the logic to update the status of a call.
4. **Increment Call Attempt**: Implement the logic to increment the attempt number of a call.

#### Step 5: Update the Agent Controller

1. **Create Agent**: Implement the endpoint to create a new agent.
2. **Get Agents**: Implement the endpoint to retrieve all agents.

#### Step 6: Update the Call Controller

1. **Create Call**: Implement the endpoint to create a new call.
2. **Get Calls**: Implement the endpoint to retrieve all calls.
3. **Update Call Status**: Implement the endpoint to update the status of a call.
4. **Increment Call Attempt**: Implement the endpoint to increment the attempt number of a call.

#### Step 7: Update the Frontend Form

1. **Agent Form**: Update the form to include additional fields and ensure it sends the correct data to the backend.
2. **Call Form**: Create a form to handle call details and update statuses.

#### Step 8: Implement AI Models

1. **Voice Recognition**: Integrate advanced voice recognition models to understand and respond to customer queries.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Integrate NLP models to interpret and generate human-like responses.

#### Step 9: Integrate with Twilio

1. **Make Calls**: Implement the logic to make calls using Twilio.
2. **Receive Calls**: Implement the logic to receive calls using Twilio.
3. **Forward Calls**: Implement the logic to forward calls to a human agent if necessary.

#### Step 10: Develop Business Logic

1. **Call Handling**: Define the business logic for handling calls, updating statuses, and measuring performance.
2. **Call Attempts**: Track call attempts and update statuses accordingly.
3. **Agent Performance**: Measure and improve performance using KPIs.

#### Step 11: Implement Data Processing

1. **CSV Upload**: Implement the logic to upload and process CSV files containing contact information.
2. **Data Storage**: Implement the logic to store and retrieve data efficiently, ensuring data integrity and security.

#### Step 12: Build and Test

1. **Develop the Agent**: Implement the AI Voice Agent, integrate with Twilio and backend services, and test thoroughly.
2. **Test the Form**: Fill out the form and submit it. Check the console logs and network tab for any errors or issues.

### Summary

- **Backend**: Define the data model, update the service, and update the controller.
- **Frontend**: Update the form to include additional fields and ensure it sends the correct data to the backend.
